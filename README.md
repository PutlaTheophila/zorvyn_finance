## Architecture

### BLoC Pattern
The application follows the **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** pattern for state management, ensuring:
- Clear separation of business logic from UI
- Predictable state management
- Testable code
- Reactive programming with streams

### Key BLoCs
1. **AuthBloc**: Manages authentication state, login, signup, and logout
2. **TransactionBloc**: Handles all transaction CRUD operations
3. **GoalBloc**: Manages financial goals and progress tracking
4. **ThemeBloc**: Controls app theme (light/dark mode)

### Data Flow
```
UI (Screens/Widgets)
    ↓ Events
BLoC Layer (Business Logic)
    ↓ Requests
Service Layer (DatabaseService, AuthService)
    ↓ CRUD Operations
Data Layer (SQLite, SharedPreferences)
```

### Database Schema

**Transactions Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  amount REAL NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  date TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL
)
```

**Goals Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE goals (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  target_amount REAL NOT NULL,
  current_amount REAL NOT NULL,
  deadline TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_completed INTEGER NOT NULL
)
```

**Categories Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  icon_code INTEGER NOT NULL,
  color_code INTEGER NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL
)
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK ^3.11.0 or higher
- Dart SDK ^3.11.0 or higher
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- iOS Simulator (Mac) or Android Emulator

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd finance_companion
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   # Android APK
   flutter build apk --release --no-tree-shake-icons

   # Android App Bundle
   flutter build appbundle --release --no-tree-shake-icons

   # iOS
   flutter build ios --release --no-tree-shake-icons
   ```

   **Note**: The `--no-tree-shake-icons` flag is required because the app uses dynamic icon loading from the database for categories. This is the recommended approach for apps with runtime-determined icons. The APK size impact is minimal (~1-2MB) since MaterialIcons font is already included.

### Running Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Generating App Icons
```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

## Design Decisions

### 1. BLoC Pattern over Provider
- Chosen for better separation of concerns
- Easier to test business logic independently
- Better suited for complex state management
- Stream-based architecture for reactive UI

### 2. SQLite for Local Storage
- Relational data structure fits finance data model
- Support for complex queries and joins
- Better performance for large datasets
- ACID compliance for data integrity

### 3. Simulated Authentication
- Uses SharedPreferences for persistent sessions
- Simulated backend with 800ms delay for realistic UX
- Easy to replace with real API integration
- Passwords stored in plain text (would be hashed in production)

### 4. Category System
- Pre-seeded with common categories
- Icon and color coding for quick recognition
- Separate categories for income and expense
- Database-driven for potential future customization

### 5. Date-based Organization
- All transactions and goals are date-aware
- Supports filtering by date ranges
- Time-series analysis for trends
- Deadline tracking for goals

### 6. Material Design
- Follows Material Design 3 guidelines
- Custom color palette with semantic meaning
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Responsive layouts

## Assumptions

1. **Authenticated User**: Users must sign up/login to use the app
2. **Single Currency**: App assumes a single currency (no multi-currency support)
3. **Single User per Device**: One active user per device installation
4. **Offline-First**: All data stored locally, no cloud sync
5. **Manual Entry**: Transactions are manually entered (no bank integration)
6. **Gregorian Calendar**: Uses standard date system
7. **No Budgets**: Focus on tracking rather than budgeting
8. **Simple Goals**: Goals are savings-focused, not category-based budgets
